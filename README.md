SBERT Embedding Search System with Hugging Face and Gemini API
Project Overview
This project is designed to allow users to perform semantic search on a text dataset retrieved from Hugging Face using SBERT (Sentence-BERT) embeddings. The project also integrates the Gemini API for further content generation and structuring of the retrieved information. The user interacts with the system through a user-friendly Streamlit interface.

Key Features:
Retrieve text data from the Hugging Face database via an open API.
Generate sentence embeddings using SBERT for the retrieved text data.
Perform semantic search based on user input queries.
Integrate Gemini API for enhanced text processing or content generation.
Display the final structured answer to the user using Streamlit.
