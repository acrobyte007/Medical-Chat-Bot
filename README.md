SBERT Embedding Search System with Hugging Face and Gemini API<br>
**Project Overview**<br>
This project is designed to allow users to perform semantic search on a text dataset retrieved from Hugging Face using SBERT (Sentence-BERT) embeddings.<br> The project also integrates the Gemini API for further content generation and structuring of the retrieved information. The user interacts with the system through a user-friendly Streamlit interface.

**Key Features:**<br>
Retrieve text data from the Hugging Face database via an open API.<br>
Generate sentence embeddings using SBERT for the retrieved text data.<br>
Perform semantic search based on user input queries.<br>
Integrate Gemini API for enhanced text processing or content generation.<br>
Display the final structured answer to the user using Streamlit.<br>
